"""Reusable SymPy -> omnimatch pattern-matching-rule machinery.

Everything needed to turn a set of rules -- each a SymPy *pattern*, a SymPy
*replacement*, and SymPy *constraints*, all written with ordinary SymPy objects
mixed with :class:`~sympy_matching.wild.WildSymbol` -- into a omnimatch
:class:`~omnimatch.matching.many_to_one.ManyToOneReplacer`. Depends ONLY on
``omnimatch`` and ``sympy_matching`` (NOT on ``sympy_wolfram`` or ``rubi_integrate``),
so any matcher (integration, equation/ODE solving, term rewriting, ...) can reuse it.

- :class:`SymPyReplacementPattern` -- one (pattern, constraints, replacement) rule.
- :func:`build_replacer` (alias ``build_tracing_replacer``) -- assemble a
  ManyToOneReplacer from rules; each
  replacement returns ``(result, (rule.module_name, rule.rule_number))`` so the
  firing rule can be traced.
- The private helpers lambdify the SymPy replacement into a omnimatch replacement
  callback and translate SymPy/logic constraints into omnimatch ``CustomConstraint``s.

History: lifted out of ``rubi_integrate.base_objects`` (was Rubi-specific by location
only), where it was called ``RubiRulePattern``/``SympyMatchingRule``.
``rubi_integrate.base_objects`` re-exports these names so Rubi imports stay unchanged.
