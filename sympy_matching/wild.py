"""SymPy-native wildcard symbols for OmniMatch patterns.

`WildSymbol` behaves like a normal `sympy.Symbol` inside SymPy expression trees,
so patterns can be written naturally with SymPy syntax. During conversion via
`to_omnimatch_expression`, it becomes the appropriate OmniMatch wildcard.

Examples:
    a_ = WildSymbol('a_')
    b_ = WildSymbol('b_', optional_value=0)
    c_ = WildSymbol('c_', optional_value=IDENTITY_ELEMENT)
    x = Symbol('x')

    # IDENTITY_ELEMENT resolves to the identity of the parent operation:
    # 0 for Add, 1 for Mul.  So c_ in `c_ + x` defaults to 0, while
    # c_ in `c_ * x` defaults to 1.

Naming convention:
    If the SymPy symbol name ends with a trailing underscore, that underscore is
    stripped when deriving the OmniMatch variable name. For example,
    `WildSymbol('a_')` becomes a wildcard with OmniMatch variable name `'a'`.
    This makes SymPy-side names like `a_`, `b_`, `c_` line up with OmniMatch
    constraint variables such as `FreeOf('a', 'x')`.
